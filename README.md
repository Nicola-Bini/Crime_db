# Crime_db

This is the final project of a SQL course for my Master in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School.
The objective was to create a normalized ER-database, queries and procedures aimed at generating insightful reports derived from crime-related data
My teammate and I decided to focus on creating reports to provide useful information for developing new government policies and aids to reduce criminality in critical areas.
