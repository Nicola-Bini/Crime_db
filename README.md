# Crime_db

This is the final project of a SQL course for my Master in Business Analytics at Hult International Business School.
The objective was to create a normalized ER-database, queries and procedures to create useful reports based on data of crimes.
Our team decided to focus on creating reports to provide useful information for developing new government policies and aids to reduce criminality in critical areas.

**Sample data**

Do not use any statistic contained in the report, all illustrative graphs and output tables have been created using randomly generated data to demonstrate how the database and queries would work.
